During the development of this library, I inspired from [Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross) (October 29, 1942 â€“ July 4, 1995) who was an American painter, art instructor, television host. He convinced many people how painting can be easy and joyful during his TV show [Joy of Painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_of_Painting). As he suggested, I tried to simplfy library interface as much as possible. Of course there might be some problems but as he said **"We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents."**.

As you can see from the [commit history](https://github.com/dnkilic/BobRoss/commits/master), sample app is implemented first. I used repository pattern to support offline mode. Following graph shows the starting architecture.

I used **Retrofit2** to fetch api, **Room** to save posts into DB, **kotlin coroutines** to perform network and db actions from background and **Glide** to show images. Following screenshot shows the sample application after first phase is completed.

During second phase BobRoss library is implemented. My main focus was simplicity of its interface. Library is able to fetch images, json and xml with memory caching functionality. I used Anko to perform background tasks. At the end of Phase 2, I replaced Retrofit and Glide with BobRoss. Following screenshot shows the sample application after second phase is completed.

During the third phase, I improved image loading capabilities by adding new features like supporting error placeholder. I added some extra features like xml fetching as well.
