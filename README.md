# BobRoss

BobRoss is an Android content loading library. Its able to load image, json and xml content while caching for efficient user experience.

During the development of this library, I inspired from [Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross) (October 29, 1942 â€“ July 4, 1995) who was an American painter, art instructor, television host. During his TV show [Joy of Painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_of_Painting) he insisted many people how painting can be easy and joyful. As he suggested, I tried to simplfy library interface as much as possible. Of course there might be some problems but as he said **"We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents."**.
