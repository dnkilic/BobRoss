During the development of this library, I inspired from [Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross) (October 29, 1942 â€“ July 4, 1995) who was an American painter, art instructor, television host. He convinced many people how painting can be easy and joyful during his TV show [Joy of Painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_of_Painting). As he suggested, I tried to simplfy library interface as much as possible. Of course there might be some problems but as he said **"We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents."**.

How do I use BobRoss?
---------------------
Image loading
```kotlin

BobRoss.with(imageView.context) // context
        .load(url) // string url
        .error(R.drawable.ic_sync_problem) // error placeholder
        .asImageInto(imageView) // imageView to load image into
        
BobRoss.with(imageView.context) // context
        .load(url) // string url
        .error(R.drawable.ic_person) // error placeholder
        .apply(ImageStyle.ROUND) // image style
        .configureCache(0) // configurable cache
        .asImageInto(imageView) // imageView to load image into
```
Content(json or xml) loading
```kotlin

BobRoss.content()
        .request(url,  onContentLoad) // string url and content load listener
        
BobRoss.content().request(url, object : OnContentLoad {
            override fun onError(throwable: Throwable) {
                // handle error
            }

            override fun onSuccess(response: String) {
                // handle success
            }
        })
```

Development
-----------
As you can see from the [commit history](https://github.com/dnkilic/BobRoss/commits/master), sample app is implemented first. I used repository pattern to support offline mode. Following graph shows the starting architecture.

</p>

I used **Retrofit2** to fetch api, **Room** to save posts into DB, **kotlin coroutines** to perform network and db actions from background and **Glide** to show images. Following screenshot shows the sample application after first phase is completed.

</p>

During second phase BobRoss library is implemented. My main focus was simplicity of its interface. Library is able to fetch images, json and xml with memory caching functionality. I used Anko to perform background tasks. **At the end of Phase 2, I replaced Retrofit and Glide with BobRoss**. Following screenshot shows the sample application after second phase is completed.

</p>

During the third phase, I improved image loading capabilities by adding new features like **supporting error placeholder**. I added some extra features like **xml fetching** as well.

</p>

During the phase four, I added **configurable bitmap caching feature**. I made some improvements on sample app like adding **animations** and implementing **favouritable images**.

There are 3 major features which need to be implemented but due to the time limitation I am not able to finish them yet. You can see [current issues](https://github.com/dnkilic/BobRoss/issues) and send a pull request of course!
